# Inference Scheduler

This project provides dynamic and pluggable scheduler components for AI
Inference requests for the LLM-d inference framework.

## About

This repository provides scheduler components for routing AI inference
requests, which get loaded into the Gateway component of LLM-d. In particular,
an "Endpoint Picker (EPP)" binary and container images are provided here which
can be configured via [Envoy]'s [ext-proc] feature to make optimized routing
decisions for AI Inference requests to backend model serving platforms (e.g.
[VLLM]).

This functionality is built upon [Gateway API] and the [Gateway API Inference
Extension (GIE)] projects for both the API resources and machinery, but extends
support beyond what's available in those projects by loading other custom
plugins needed by LLM-D (e.g. custom scorers, P/D Disaggregation, etc).
